# Make sure you've pinned the version of golangci-lint by running this command
# in your project directory:
#   GO111MODULE=on go get github.com/golangci/golangci-lint@v1.21.0
# You should see this line in your go.mod file:
#   github.com/golangci/golangci-lint v1.21.0
before_script:
  - go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint

# script always runs to completion (set +e). If we have linter issues AND a
# failing test, we want to see both. Configure golangci-lint with a
# .golangci.yml file at the top level of your repo.
script:
  - golangci-lint run       # run a bunch of code checkers/linters in parallel
  - go build ./...          # build the project
  - go test -v -race ./...  # Run all the tests with the race detector enabled
