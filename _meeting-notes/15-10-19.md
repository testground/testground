## :mega: Update (Done, Shipped, Made Progress)

- ==@raulk==
  - Shipped
- ==@daviddias==
  - Explored and tinkered a ton how to get go-ipfs to work as a library vs working through an IPTB wrapper, ended up:
    - Blazing through the go-ipfs forest to get a working example unixfs.Get with go-ipfs as a Library https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6695
    - Improving smlbench plan (that uses go-ipfs through IPTB) https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/60 
  - Iterated on the Test Narratives design https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/33
  - Improved the DHT Test Plan docs and structure https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/59
  - Sync with Jim on TestGround plan and priorities https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/63
  - Restructured how we run meetings and how we follow up to action items  https://github.com/ipfs/testground#team
- ==@jimpick==
  - (was sick much of last week)
  - Sync with David on TestGround plan and priorities https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/63
  - Elasticsearch ... using "Elasticsearch" service via AWS Marketplace
    - Fairly generic Filebeat setup (JSON, Container input). Was missing data, fix is to increase polling frequency to 1s or tell testground to retain containers. https://gist.github.com/jimpick/fb3e5c841ae5d8c2436a5f8654bb0cf2
    - [Demo video](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmahm2x4UGqGgkeVhijTF1SvmekhiphfLgK2uQxTU95y8P/testground-filebeat.mp4) (23s)
  - Hashicorp Packer
    - Docker CE, go 1.13, Filebeat, and redis-server
    - tested with EC2 auto-scaling group, Docker Swarm
    - https://github.com/jimpick/testground-packer-templates
  - Docs / Issues
    - Document Cloud Setup on AWS https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/62
      - Needs a bit more discussion
      - Recorded a video showing how to setup admin account ... initially thought video would be easier, but going to switch to web tutorial due to need to blur things if sharing publicly
      - Best way to communicate? Place to accumulate docs? (testground repo feels overloaded to me)
    - Rationales / decision issues
      - Not sure best place to have these conversations? GitHub might be the wrong place ... not intended to question spec or decisions that have been made
      - [vs. Testlab](https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/64)
      - [vs. ipfs/benchmarks](https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/66)
      - [Elasticsearch Options](https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/67)
      - [Grafana vs. Kibana](https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/68)
  - Made "playground" repo for experimentation
  - Booked tickets to Tenerife
  

## :question: Questions (Blockers, Technical Design needs)

- (@daviddias) How should I go about tests that require ingesting multiple TBs of data? (non-blocker for this week)
    - Options:
      - Use EBS snapshot. Mount for the test
      - Questions:
        - Will we have infrastructure provider dependent tests?
- (@daviddias) (might) Need a tip on getting smlbench to work https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/60/files#r331433948
- (@jimpick) Improvements to communication / documentation - I'm trying to restrict myself to GitHub, but unsure of how to structure things...
  - How to deal with Secrets?
    - Use <INSERT TOKEN HERE> notes and then let people know (FAQ) that they need 1password
  - Answer: All in one repo for now (docs, examples, tutorials, code)
