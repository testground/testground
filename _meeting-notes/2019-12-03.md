## :mega: Update (Done, Shipped, Made Progress)
> To be reviewed Async

- ==@raulk==
    - Little progress since I was on holiday last week, and now combating my backlog.
    - Thought about multiversion test runs; planning to write a design blueprint.
        - Gist: new concept "ensemble". An ensemble is a cohort of runs that run with the same ID but using different build outputs.
        - Depends on tracking the dependency graph. Who can own this?
    - Refactored the DHT plan. Currently a WIP PR; need to push it over the finish line this week.
    - Arranging/negotiating travels for testground hack week.
- ==@daviddias==
    - Created Onboarding Work Plan for Henrique
    - Coordinated the handing of the Infra Responsibilities from Jim to Anton
    - Created the MVP/Primary Goal issue https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/196
    - Made the plans and handled the logistics for the next Team "Onboarding" Hack Week
    - Created a PRD for the TestGround Dashboard
    - Reviewed PRs
    - Did not have any tasty Thanksgiving Holidays food (we need that holiday here! :D)
- ==@stebalien==
    - Out Nov 27(Wed) - Nov 29(Fri) for Thanksgiving
- ==@jimpick==
    - Done:
        - Hand off "Infra Lead" to Anton https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/192 (recording a Zoom call on Friday)
    - Made progress:
        - Started on Test Plan 4 - "Nodes Connectivity (Transports, Hole Punching, Relay)" https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/96
        - Figured out how to implement a NAT inside a (privileged) Docker container - does the sidecar model work for this?
        - Wrote up some starter ideas ... "connectivity obstacle course"
    - Updated smlbench2 - as requested, rebased and renamed to data-transfer-datasets-random
        - https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/74
        - Not working yet - networking fails, needs further investigation
        - Can't be merged yet ... it makes nasty modifications to Dockerfile.template in pkg/build/golang - needs to be cleaner
        - Doesn't map well to proposed tests written for data-transfer-datasets-random
    - PR: Add status badges to plans https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/200
- ==@nonsense==
    - Done:
        - Finished onboarding document
        - `daemon` PR ready for review and mostly finished first iteration: https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/183
    - In progress:
        - Took over `infra` PR from Jim: https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/175
- ==@hacdias==
    - Done
        - Started going over the Onboarding Document, reading SPEC, usage and other documents.
        - Added support for array and arbitrary JSON objects as test parameters ([PR](https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/198)).
        - Started working on [Chew Large Datasets](https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/58)
    - In Progress
        - Onboarding Document


## :question: Questions (Blockers, Technical Design needs)
> We only have 30 mins for this section, use your time wisely

- @daviddias - What is the state of sidecar? Is there a recorded demo of what it does and how to configure it for the DHT Test Plan?
    - Currently, it supports:
        - Bandwidth limitting
        - Assign IP addersses (aka setting network topologies, but not NATs)
    - Jitter support is coming up
    - Steven got a new idea from Jim! 
        - ~~AI: Steven/Jim to write what is that idea => https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/96#issuecomment-559888146~~ (moved to Assignments, below)
- @raulk - who can own dependency graph tracking? It's a blocker for test ensembles.
    - This should be an abstraction over the build step
    - [#147](https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/147)
    - ^^ ~~AI: Henrique own this (Raul and/or Anton can pair on this, if needed)~~ (moved to Assignments, below)
    - ~~AI: David will create a epic out of this..~~ (moved to Assignments, below)
- @nonsense - https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/196 unblocking IPFS - deadline? timeframe?
    - ASAP
    - Question for Hack Week: What is the degree of confidence to which we will feel confortable to ship a go-ipfs release <- unpack this a bit more
    - Ask: The sooner we get a Test Plan on the DHT to run to get the Core Devs to use, the better
        - It's "possible today". Two Camps
            - A) Bring go-devs today to run the DHT plan as is (they will have panics to look at already)
            - B) Wait until TestGround has a better DX (Dashboard, TestGround as a Service, full Network config features)
        - On the first camp A), we can bring people to start writting Test Plans
            - Data Point: We've railled in Vyzo, Dirk, Adin and Alex to start writting Test Plans. Dirk & Vyzo are the most advanced so far but still far
- @jimpick - to @raulk: i've been asked to redline the spec document to show out-of-date content. What's the best way to sync it to the current state? Is this urgent?
    - Should we:
        - A) Declare a "Historical Document"
        - B) Redline the spec
    - Alternatively: C) Rewrite the spec (AI: Raul to rewrite the spec, not this week but possibly next week)
    - Another option (in parallel) Creating mini specs, named "Design Blueprints". First one is "Test Ensembles"
- @stebalien - to @raulk: what's the status of the DHT test refactor. The test is currently broken but I don't want to spend time fixing it if we're going to rewrite it.
    - AI: Steven will finish the DHT Refactor PR
- ASKs
    - @daviddias - ASK: Please use Kanban board to communicate effectively the state of your issues/PRs. I keep seeing PRs in the "New Issues" column and wondering if you want review or not. If you haven't, read: https://github.com/ipfs/testground/blob/master/docs/HOW_WE_WORK.md
        -~~ AI: make this discoverable! (David)~~ (moved to Assignments, below)
    - @raulk - ASK: to @stebalien: could you write a design blueprint for traffic shaping? Let's make the current behaviour the starting point. Further enhancements / changes would be patches on top of that doc.
        - ~~YES! AI: Steven said he can do it. <- push it to the docs folder~~ (moved to Assignments, below)


## :dart: Next

~~### OKRs for the Quarter~~ #1 Goal: Unblock go-ipfs 0.5.0
~~https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipfs/testground/master/docs/img/Q4OKRs.png~~
~~### Top 3 things to get done this week~~



We are putting aside the OKRs for the time being and instead **focus on the #1 Goal: Unblock go-ipfs 0.5.0**. This goal has a very clear list of things that need to ship:

- [ ] Instrument go-libp2p so that the DHT operations are observable and traced in a Distributed Context (owner: @raulk)
- [ ] Add support to Traffic Shaping & Network Configuration to TestGround (owner: @Stebalien)
- [ ] Expand the TestGround Infrastructure so that it can run multiple thousands of nodes (owner: @nonsense)
- [ ] Creation of a TestGround Dashboard that can aid the developers of go-ipfs & go-libp2p to grok the results outputted by every node in a TestGround run (owner: @daviddias)
- [ ] Keep on iterating the DHT Test Plan (@owner: @daviddias)
- [ ] Design blueprint for multi-version tests (aka test ensembles) (owner: @raulk)

Full list can be at https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/196
