## :question: Questions (Blockers, Technical Design needs)

> What do people want to see for plan sdk polish? I tried to abstract the phase/chapter/act, into a state machine factory pattern. I was considering the way programming looks in apache airflow -- but this is probably not something people want and will probably close it.- resolved

> For docker volumes, do people care about bind mounts?- Yes, Per Raul, Bindmounts to use named volumes.

> (@coryschwartz) Metrics/Prometheus/OpenCensus.
 - If we want to expose a richer model to the test plan developer, we should consider adding a method on the RunEnv that gives the dev access to the OpenCensus API.
     - @nonsense - We should have - counters, gauges, histograms (timers / min,max,avg,95%ile,99%ile) as a metric.
