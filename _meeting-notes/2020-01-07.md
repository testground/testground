## :mega: Update (Done, Shipped, Made Progress)
> To be reviewed Async

- ==@raulk==
  - Got done
    - [OpenTracing in kad dht](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/compare/feat/tracing)
    - Fixed the sync service by migrating it to Redis PubSub. Works with 5000 nodes (despite the DHT test plan failing).
    - Completed the retro.
    - Very little, as I was on holiday.
  - Didn't get done (and had commited to last week)

    - IP address assignment
    - Sidecar testcase
  - Didn't get done (and had commited to last week)
    - Blocking inbound connections
  - Blocked
    - ...
- ==@nonsense==
  - In progress
      - Investigated how to run multiple networks (default cluster network + secondary overlay network) on self-serviced Kubernetes (with kops) -
          - Tested Weave, Flannel, Multus, CNI-Genie, CNI whereabouts
          - https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/299
          - https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/295
          - https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/318
  - Got done
      - README on how to setup k8s cluster with Flannel - https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/317
      - README on how to setup k8s cluster with Weave - https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/323
      - Tested CNI-Genie vs Multus - we have the same problems with Weave when it is called through both meta CNIs
  - Didn't get done
      - Investigated how to run multiple networks (default cluster network + secondary overlay network) on managed Kubernetes - https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/299
          - We decided to drop the `managed` Kubernetes part, because it got obvious that various CNIs won't work when you don't have access to the k8s master node, or don't know which volumes are writable by various DaemonSets
  - Didn't get done (and had commited to last week)
    - ...
  - Blocked
    - Feedback on the `in-progress` and `done` tasks would be helpful. Currently we can't manually assign IPs in given subnet, but we do have two networks (control and secondary data plane) - I think it makes sense updating `sidecar` to detect the data plane network (currently it is detecting only Docker networks) and try out a testplan even without manual IP assignment. What do you think?

## :question: Questions (Blockers, Technical Design needs)
> We only have 30 mins for this section, use your time wisely

- (@handle) QUESTION
- (@nonsense) Feedback on the Kubernetes Networking part would be helpful. Currently we can't manually assign IPs in given subnet (someone willing to double-check this part for me?), but we do have two networks (control and secondary data plane) - I think it makes sense updating `sidecar` to detect the data plane network (currently it is detecting only Docker networks) and try out a testplan even without manual IP assignment. What do you think?
- (@raulk): request for @nonsense to present his work on testing networking plugins for Kubernetes, i.e. a few slides comparing all the options, how we went about this exploration, what we learnt along the way, and how we decided to pick what we picked. In fact, we could package this into a blog post for public broadcast.
        - @nonsense: Sure, will do that tomorrow. For now, refer to:
            - Weave/Flannel setup: https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/323 (there is a 5min demo with asciinema)
            - Flannel/Flannel setup: https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/317
- (@nonsense): Could you extend a bit on `Works with 5000 nodes (despite the DHT test plan failing).` ? What was the setup? Docker Swarm on AWS? How many nodes? Which playbooks did you use for the setup?
    - filecoin miner gig machine
    - local runner

## :dart: Next

### Top 3 things to get done this week

...

### Assignments

- ==@raulk==
  - Occupied with ResNetLab intensive workshop, and catching up after holidays.
  - Brainstorm detailed technical plan for go-ipfs 0.5.0 unblocking.
- ==@daviddias==
  - 
- ==@nonsense==
  - Presentation on current state of Kubernetes networking - describe Weave, Flannel, Multus, CNI-Genie, whereabouts CNI, etc. managed k8s offerings vs self-serviced k8s offerings
  - Continue with Kubernetes networking CNI evaluation - Canal, Calico - basically trying to find a CNI that allows us to set manually IP addresses to containers
  - Maybe check if the `sidecar` can detect a network interface on the host, and not just Docker networks, unless @stebalien has done/will do that.
- ==@hacdias==
  - 
- ==@jimpick==
  - 
- ==@stebalien==
  - Blocking inbound connections
      - Maybe? I'm tempted to just do this in libp2p by not listening.
